            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Nina Campbell, I am 18 years old and was born here in Ottawa. My family has two pets; a dog named Coco and a rabbit named Nemo. The rabbit is new, but my family has always had a dog around. I feel like I’m a pretty bland person overall, but if I had to describe myself in a couple words, they would be quiet and indecisive because it took me a few minutes to actually think of a couple words but that’s besides the point.</p>
            
            <p>Some of my hobbies are digital art and video games. I’ve been practicing digital art for around 5 years now but I’ve been playing video games for pretty much my entire life. I love games that allow you to explore an open world freely; Minecraft and Genshin Impact being two of my favourites. My love for these things is why I chose the Interactive Media Design program, in hopes that it’ll guide me to a future career in this creative field.</p>
